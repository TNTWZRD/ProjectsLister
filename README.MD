Place this in the root directory of your Apache2 Webserver
This php script will automaticly add each new folder you have on the browser page.

If you would like to set a title and description for your websites and new Projects add them in projectNames.json
following the same convention as the curently existing files.

"FILENAME": {
  "title":"LINK TITLE",
  "desc":"PROJECT DESCRIPTION",
  "newTab":"True / False"
}

newTab True opens link in new tab, false opens link in current tab.
